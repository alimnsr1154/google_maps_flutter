# Maps

A Maps Flutter project.

## Getting Started
I created a google maps application integrated by the google Maps API. There are total of three search boxes on the main screen.

### Search for city

The first search box is for searching any city in the world. you have to write the city name and click onto the city icon button in order to search it.

### Search for route
The second and third search boxes are for the origin and destination and you can find the route between them. Write the origin in the second box and the destination in the third box . After that, click onto the search button and you will get the route.
